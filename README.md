**Nicholas Ponvert**

##Selected Research Experience

*Efferent control of trout lateral line neuromasts*
January 2013 – pres

* Wrote IACUC protocol
* Performed minor surgery to introduce fluorescent tracer into lateral line nerve with fish under general anesthesia
* Made paraformaldehyde solutions and perfused fish transcardially
* Maintained laboratory stocks of teleost ringer solution and phosphate-buffered saline
* Made microscope slides subbed with gelatin and chrome alum
* Dissected brains and lateral line nerves out and postfixed in paraformaldehyde
* Sectioned brains using a cryostat (section thickness – 8 microns)
* Performed immunohistochemistry on trout brain sections using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) monoclonal IgG antibody
* Imaged backfill label and TH label in trout brain sections using epifluorescent compound microscopy and laser confocal microscopy


*Improving draft genomes using mate-pair data*
April 2013 – pres

* Wrote Biopython code to index and search large FASTA files (~6 million reads)
* Set up local BLAST+ databases and ran `blastn` searches
* Aligned short reads using `velvet`, `ssaha`, `CAP3`, Sequencher, and CodonCode Aligner
* Identified repetitive sequence elements such as rRNA operons and integrase sequences
* Wrote python algorithms to improve draft genome coverage around and through areas with repetitive sequence elements using mate-pair data

*Looking for SNPs in Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius HSU9 integrase sequences*
August 2013 – December 2013

* Used conserved regions of consensus HSU9 integrase sequence to pick appropriate PCR primers
* Extracted genomic DNA from A. acidocaldarius HSU9
* Amplified integrase sequences using PCR
* Ligated PCR products into pGEM-T vectors and transformed E. coli
* Screened resulting white colonies for PCR insert size and extracted plasmids
* Sent plasmids out for dye-terminator sequencing
* Aligned sequences and counted number and position of SNPs.
* Wrote Biopython code to determine the number of contigs that flank integrase sequences in the HSU9 genome

##Selected Academic Work Experience

*Biology core facility technician* 
January 2014 – pres
Duties:

* Calibrate and maintain equipment in the Biology core facility (currently responsible for the maintaince of a Dionex ICS-90 ion chromatography system)
* Assist students with molecular biology research projects by assisting with DNA extraction protocols, PCR protocols, and bioinformatics projects.
* Design lab equipment and parts in Solidworks (CAD software) and fabricate using a Stratasys U-print SE plus 3D printer
* Conduct laboratory safety inspections
* Check out equipment to students
